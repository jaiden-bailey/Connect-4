# Connect-4
A command line connect four game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Connect 4 game in Python. Connect 4 is a two-player connection game in which the players choose a color and take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before the opponent.
